        My name is Yue Leng, an ambitious student currently majoring in Interactive Design. My journey in design began when I realized the power of the creative process in conveying complex ideas simply and beautifully. I am particularly intrigued by the intersection of technology and design, and how this synergy can create meaningful user experiences. When I'm not immersed in the world of design, I satisfy my wanderlust through travelling, capturing the world's beauty through my lens. Photography not only nurtures my creative spirit, but also encourages me to view the world from different perspectives. I am wholeheartedly committed to my journey of learning and growing, with the dream of making significant contributions to the design world.
